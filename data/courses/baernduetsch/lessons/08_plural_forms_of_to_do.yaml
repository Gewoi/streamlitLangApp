      ## Plural Forms
      
      Again, **mache** (*to do*) is a regular verb, so most of the other forms will follow the same patterns as it. 
      
      Now, the *plural* forms of the verb are:
      
      | **English** |  | **Bärndütsch** |  |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | We | *do* | **Mir** | **mach*e*** |
      | You (pl.) | *do* | **Dir** | **mach*it*** / **mach*et*** |
      | They | *do* | **Si** | **mach*e***|
      
      Note that we use **Si** for both the *singular *she** and for the *plural *they**. This might seem confusing at first, but you can always tell what is meant **from context**.
      
      After **Si**:
      - If the verb ends with *-t*, we're talking about **she**
      - If the verb ends with *-e*, we're talking about **they**
