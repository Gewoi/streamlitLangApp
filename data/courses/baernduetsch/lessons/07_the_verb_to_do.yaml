      ## Regular Verbs, Singular
      
      Most verbs follow a fairly regular structure. Let's look at **mache** (pronounced a bit like *machä*). It conjugates the following way:
      
      <center>
      
      | **English** |  | **Bärndütsch** |  |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | I | *do* | **I / Ig** | **mach*e*** |
      | You | *do* | **Du** | **mach*sch*** |
      | He / She / It | *does* | **Är / Si / Äs** | **mach*t***|
      
      </center>
      
      A lot of verbs conjugate the same way in singular. 
      
      Not that there's two ways to say *I*: **I** and **Ig**. Both of them are equivalent, use whichever you like!

      Correct!

      ## Word Order
      
      You might have already seen it with **Wie geits dir?** and now with **Was macht si?**:
      
      - If we have a question, we *flip the order*; the **verb** comes first, and then the **pronoun**.
      
      This is a feature of regular German too, so you might be familiar with this; it works the same in Bärndütsch!

      Correct!
      
      This person is asking *What is he doing?*. Sometimes you'll hear it shortened to **Was machter?**, but both of these are equivalent!

      This person is saying **Was machsch du?**, which is **What* are you doing?*.

      ## Öppis
      
      The word for *something* is **Öppis** in Bärndütsch.
      
      A lot of words in Bärndütsch are very similar to the German ones. But a few, often quite *commonly used words*, are **different**.
      
      **Öppis** is the prime example for that. And it is fun to say!
      
      **I mache öppis** <-> *I'm doing something*

    solution_display: |
      Correct!
      
      **Was** means *what*, and **öppis** means something. Important: In a question, the *verb* and the *pronoun* **switch places**!
