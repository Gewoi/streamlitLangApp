      ## Polite Form
      
      
      In Switzerland, we often use a *polite form*. You usually do this with the following people:
      
      - Strangers in some settings (usually work related)
      - People of status (for example a professor when you''re a student often)
      - Elderly people
      
      It is often acceptable to just skip using this form with a lot of people. However, some people (especially *elderly people*) can get **offended** when it isn'tused with them. So let's look at it!

      ✅ Correct! Greeting someone politely is **Grüessech**.
      
      We say **Herr** for *Mister*, and **Frou** for *Miss*.

      ## Grüessech vs. Grüezi
      
      In Bern, the correct way to greet someone formally is **Grüessech**.
      
      You might have heard of **Grüezi**; this is how it is said in *Zürich*. Switzerland has many dialects that vary between them.
      
      But don't worry! Once you understand one, the other ones will be easy to understand too!
      
      Here, we'll focus on **Bärndütsch** (Bernese Swiss German); therefore *Grüezi* unfortunately does not count as a correct answer.

      When asking how someone is doing *in the polite form*, we add **Öich** at the end.
      
      Don't get confused: The Germans use *Ihnen* here. But we use **Öich**!

    answer: "False"
    solution_display: |
      ✅ Correct!
      
      At the end of the *formal* way, we say **Öich**! The *informal* way would just be **Wie geit's? / Wie geit's dir?**, without the **Öich**.

      Very good! This is how you ask *politely* how someone is doing: Use **Öich**!

      ## "And"
      
      There are two was to say *and* in Bärndütsch:
      
      - **U**
      - **Und**
      
      Bot of them are more or less equivalent, so choose whichever you like!

    answer: "True"
    solution_display: |
      ✅ Correct!
      
      Often, when you use the *polite* form towards elderly people, they will still use the *informal* form toward you. But you should **still use the *polite*** form unless they make it clear it's ok not to!
      
      (Yes I think that's annoying too)
