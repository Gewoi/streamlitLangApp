      ## Polite Form


      In Switzerland, we often use a *polite form*. You usually do this with the following
      people:


      - Strangers in some settings (usually work related)

      - People of status (for example a professor when you''re a student often)

      - Elderly people


      It is often acceptable to just skip using this form with a lot of people. However,
      some people (especially *elderly people*) can get **offended** when it isn''t
      used with them. So let''s look at it!'
